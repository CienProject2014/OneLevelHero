##**Overlap2dRuntime**

The Overlap2dRuntime provides functionality to load, manipulate and render scenes generated by [Overlap2D](http://overlap2d.com/).

##**Setup**

1. Download the Overlap2D Runtime source using [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) or by downloading it as a [zip](https://github.com/gevorg-kopalyan/Overlap2dRuntime/archive/master.zip) and extarct it somewhere.
2. If you don't have Gradle Eclipse plugin then you can go [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/eclipse-integration-gradle) and install it.
3. Using Eclipse Grdale plugin, import the project by choosing File -> Import -> Gradle -> Gradle project.

For alternative or other IDEs you will need to create a new project and import the source.
Or you can just copy all sources to your project.

##Spine

[Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/) animations are now optional. You must download [spine libgdx runtime](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/master/spine-libgdx) and include it in your project. If you don't have spine runtime SpineActors will not be created and used by overlap2druntime.

##Note

Please note that [Overlap2D](http://overlap2d.com/) is in development and this runtime is for test purposes.
While sources might stay same, architecture will definitely change.
Also you can try to write your own runtime based on this.
